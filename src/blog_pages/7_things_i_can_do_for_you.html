        <h1>7 Things Inklings and Geeklings Can do for You</h1>
        <p>Welcome! I am so excited to be starting this chapter of my life, and with it, this blog. I have big ideas,
          big
          plans, and big dreams, and all of them, dear reader, involve helping you. I'm starting this blog with the goal
          of
          spreading hope, creativity, and joy. I want to help you tell your story, embrace your divine ability to
          create, and
          bless your family while doing it. How? Well, I'm glad you asked! Here are seven things you can expect me to do
          for
          you if you stick around.</p>

      <li>
        <h4>Review, vet, and suggest some incredible books</h4>
        <p>Books. They're what I do. They're what I LIVE for. If I could read for a living, I would. Oh wait, I do!
          Really
          though, I devour books. I read as much as I can, as often as I can, and as thoroughly as I can. And from that,
          I
          get some pretty good suggestions. However, I know that not everyone has the same taste when it comes to books,
          so I'm committed to giving you detailed reviews and specific recommendations. I'll provide content and trigger
          warnings, specify what audience a book is meant for, and give you an idea of what you'll enjoy based on what
          you've already read. Keep an eye out for round up lists, reviews, and teasers! I also LOVE delving into the
          depth of a story, so you may even see an analysis here and there. I read a lot of clean romance, YA, and
          classics, but you'll also see some recommendations from my little Geeklings!</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Give some fabulous writing and editing advice</h4>
        <p>You may have gathered already that I'm a little obsessed with books. You know, maybe. I mean, I did get my
          degree in English, with an emphasis in creative writing, and I currently work as an editor. I may not have
          written the next great American novel yet, but I know a few things! And I'm happy to share what I've learned,
          as
          well as what I'm still learning! Watch for tips and tricks, grammar explained, and vital editing and
          publishing
          info. I'm here to help!</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Connect you to the perfect editorial and publishing services</h4>
        <p>It's me. Hi! I'm the editor! It's me. Okay, maybe not for every stage of your publishing journey, but I do
          offer some pretty great editorial services. If you need line editing, copyediting, or proofreading, I'm your
          girl! I do specifically stick to clean/wholesome manuscripts, but if that's you, I'd love to chat! Check out
          my
          services page and send me an email if I can help you! And for the services I don't provide, I'll help connect
          you with people who can do exactly what you need. I'll be featuring posts about cover design, beta reading,
          developmental and content editing, and marketing. If you offer one of these services, let me know and I'll be
          glad to feature you! And if you're looking for someone, I'll do my best to help you find the right
          professional
          for the job.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Teach and provide ideas for a variety of crafts and creative pursuits</h4>
        <p>Although I primarily center around books and writing here, the real goal is to grow overall creativity. I'm
          all
          about finding ways to express yourself through whichever medium call to you. I love trying new things, so
          you'll
          see a variety of crafting ideas on here. I'll most likely feature a lot of crochet, sewing, Cricut, and bullet
          journaling, but I'm always on the lookout for fun new ideas, and new artistic practices to try. I believe that
          if you want to, you should! Even if you don't commit to becoming a master, arts and crafts are a beautiful
          form
          of creative self care.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Help you organize your ideas and goals</h4>
        <p>If you're anything like me, and you want to try EVERYTHING, it can be hard to know where to start and what to
          focus on. Do you have a million projects going at once? Do you have a hard time finishing anything? Cause
          same.
          But we can work on this together! I'll be sharing a lot of my bullet journaling ideas and methods, and that's
          helped me a lot! I'll also provide tips for sticking with a project, organizing your mind and your space, and
          setting reasonable creative goals.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Guide you as you teach your children to live a life of literacy, creativity, and joy</h4>
        <p>The only calling I feel more deeply than creativity is that of motherhood, and I know I'm not alone. My kids
          are my world! And there's so much I want to teach them about stories and art and love and FUN! But it can be
          hard to take time to love yourself when you're so focused on loving little Geeklings. So I'm going to help you
          do both. Keep an eye out for educational, sensory, and fun ideas for things to do with your littles, as well
          as
          tips for surviving motherhood, whether you're a stay at home mom, a working mom, a single mom, or just a hot
          mess mom.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Provide a space of love, understanding, and creative freedom</h4>
        <p>It can be a lonely world out there. It can be hard to make friends as an adult, and especially a mother. It
          can
          be hard to live authentically when there's so much judgement around you. I see you. I hear you. You're doing
          great, and you are enough. I want to make sure you remember that! Check in for an occasional pep talk,
          reassurance, and the certainty that this is a safe space, and I am a safe person. If you're looking for
          specific
          resources, tips, or ideas, let me know, and I'll see what I can do! I hope this will turn into a fruitful
          business for me, but mostly, I just want to help. I want to help you tell your story, and I want to love you
          while you do it.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>I am so excited to be here. I hope you can feel my sincere joy through my words, because I really believe this is
      the path I am meant to be on. I can't wait to share my story, and to help you share yours. I can't wait to teach
      my
      children and watch them grow in joy, and to help you do the same. My beautiful friends, I hope you'll stick
      around!
      Leave a comment letting me know how I can help you, and I'll find the best way for us to learn and grow together.
    </p>
