        <h1>7 Sweet Historical Romance Authors You'll Love</h1>
        <p>I'll read just about anything, but sweet historical romance has a special place in my heart. Although I enjoy the
          process of analyzing long novels with myriad literary devices and complex themes, it gets a little difficult to do
          that with my two little Geeklings running around, work to do, things to write, and a life to live. Sweet historical
          romance has become one of my favorite alternatives. While generally more lighthearted than a variety of other
          genres, I love the character exploration that comes from a good romance. There's so much you can see about human
          nature in how a romance develops, and how healthy the relationship becomes. Plus, romance is just fun. It's fun to
          watch the awkward moments, feel the heat of the tense moments, and watch the story weave into a happily ever after.
          Add in a vivid historical backdrop, where I can read about how people lived in a vastly different time and place,
          and I'm sold.</p>
        <p>Sweet historical romance is a quickly growing genre. While even ten years ago there weren't many books to be found
          under that category, it isn't hard to find one now. While Christian publishers seem to be a good bet for finding
          these gems, there are a lot of indie authors who deserve the reads too! With so many good options out there, it can
          be hard to know where to start! Even though I've been reading these for a while, I still get overwhelmed looking at
          all the beautiful books I haven't read yet. But, since I've been reading in this space for a while, I do know a few
          good places to start! There are so many more who deserve to be highlighted here, but I wanted to keep it simple with
          just a few. So, in no particular order, here are seven sweet historical romance authors you'll love, and a
          suggestion on which book to start with for each.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Sarah M Eden</strong> is truly one of the greats of sweet historical romance. A forerunner and a front
          runner of the genre, she sets the standard high. Look to her for a variety of time periods, including Georgian,
          Regency, Victorian, and Western. Her stories are marked by particularly strong characters, many of whom have
          disabilities or serious trauma. Although there's lots of lighthearted joy in her books, there's a lot of depth
          too, which is something I love! She manages to address difficult issues in the midst of incredibly sweet, tender
          love stories. She has a few different series, some connected and some not, so it's hard to know where to start!
          But my recommendation is that you start with Seeking Persephone. It's a great intro to her Regency universe and
          characters, and it's one of her best!</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Esther Hatch</strong> is a master of swoon. I honestly haven't read much of her work, but what I have
          has made me, well, swoon! Her A Proper Scandal series is where it's at if you want something that takes your
          breath away, but in a strictly proper manner. Set in Victorian England, this series displays some of the awesome
          development and social change of the time period, and offers a fascinating glimpse into what life may have been
          like. And the characters?? Incredible. They all have beautiful arcs, believable growth, and they're oh, so
          lovable. And Lord Bryant? *sigh* IYKYK.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Joanna Barker</strong> creates some incredible characters. I particularly love her heroines! While so
          many stories have such forced strong, willful, wild, independent heroines, Joanna's are strong in their own
          subtle way, without dissing on traditional femininity. I've only read two books and one novella by her, but I
          have loved each of them, enough that I've purchased two more books that I'll be reading the second I get the
          chance! I recommend checking out her most recent release, A Heart Worth Stealing, for a subtly strong heroine, a
          page-turning mystery, and a new auto-buy author.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Arlem Hawks</strong> rules the seas! Although not all of her stories take place on board a ship,
          everything (that I've read) has some connection to the ocean, and she makes my mountain-dwelling soul understand
          why people love the sea. And where there's ships, there's battle. Arlem explores some of the intricacies of navy
          life, while also examining the motives and morals behind war, including the French Revolution. Her stories are
          so incredibly rich in history, while still being sweet and adorably romantic. Georganna's Secret is a great
          place to start for an immersive sea experience on paper, but be prepared to pick up her French Revolution
          prequels immediately after!</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Megan Walker</strong> writes almost painfully romantic love stories. She specializes in beautiful
          couples that are perfect for each other in every way. It's a joy to read her cozy stories and watch as these
          characters discover each other and their relationships develop into deep, heartwarming love. Megan is the type
          of author to make you believe in true, lasting love! Pick up Lakeshire Park for a perfect book to read by the
          fire, and prepare the get lost in the beautiful estate she has created here while you fall in love with her
          characters.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Karen Thornell</strong> is a little newer to the scene of sweet historical romance, but friends, she
          nails it. Her books are so, so beautiful, and you're really missing out if you haven't picked her up yet! Karen
          creates beautiful, vivid backdrops for her swoon-worthy stories, and sucks you in from the beginning! You'll
          love her intricate characters and all they bring to the table, even the side characters and villains! I
          recommend starting with To Marry an Earl for a cozy autumn read with rain falling in the background. You'll feel
          totally transported to the scene, so be prepared to live in the book until you finish!</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Kasey Stockton</strong> covers a lot of bases, and I've only scratched the surface of her work! But if
          you're dying for a Scottish sweet romance, like I was for so long, Journey to Bongary Spring, is a great place
          to start. With its touching unrequited love romance and questing storyline, she paints the scene so well. Kilts,
          coos, and highland fog. *sigh* I need to reread this one! There's something especially enchanting about
          Scotland, its scenery and folklore, its history and culture. And Kasey GETS IT.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Did I give you a few ideas? I sure hope so! Even if you've been reading sweet historical romances for a while,
      maybe you found a new suggestion? A TBR book to move up your list? Leave a comment and let me know! Who are your
      favorite sweet historical romance authors? Anyone in particular I missed? I'd love to hear about it!</p>
    <p>Happy reading!</p>
