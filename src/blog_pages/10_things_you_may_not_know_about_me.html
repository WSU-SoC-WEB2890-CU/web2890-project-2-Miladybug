        <h1>10 Things You May Not Know About Me</h1>
        <p>You know what fascinates me? People. People fascinate me. There's always so many facets and so much depth to every
          individual. You can spend your whole life getting to know a person and still not know everything. And yet, there are
          so many similarities connecting us all as human beings; it's fascinating! I love getting to know individual people,
          learning what they love, and what makes them tick. There's so much uniqueness to each one of us, and I love trying
          to dig it out, even when it comes to myself!</p>
        <p>I'm a pretty simple person on the surface. I love books. I love my kids. But as with everyone, there's more than
          meets the eye! So here are some things you might not guess about me.</p>

      <li>Autumn is my favorite season. I've found this is true for a lot of book nerds, and even creatives in general, so
        I guess it makes sense. There's something about foggy, rainy days and the vivid oranges and yellows of leaves that
        just make my soul do a little happy dance. I don't know if it's the relief of making it to the end of a hot Utah
        summer, the excitement of a new school year, or just the air smelling of pumpkin spice, but I love all of it.</li>
      <li>I love birds. When asked if I'm a cat person or a dog person, I'll usually say I'm a bird person. It's a little
        odd, I know, but I really do think birds are the coolest. Hummingbirds with their insanely fast heartbeats and
        blurry wings, parrots with their bright colors and impressive intelligence, owls with their large eyes and
        powerful, swooping wings. I love them all. I'm pretty sure that I'll be the birdwatching old lady someday, with
        binoculars slung around my neck and an Audubon Field Guide to Birds in my hand.</li>
      <li>I'm fascinated by anatomy and all things human body, especially the brain. But I never thought I could deal with
        the emotional burden of working in medicine. So instead, I just take a casual interest in human anatomy, finding
        wonder in how it all fits together, how every body part has its purpose, but also how so many things can go wrong.
        I even competed in the anatomy events in Science Olympiad in high school, and while I never placed in anatomy, I
        did take first place in the "disease detectives" event, which I hadn't even studied for! It was a great experience
        and I learned so much, but these days I mostly scratch the itch by watching medical dramas and reading up on
        bizarre conditions on WebMD.</li>
      <li>I'm a divorced single mom of 2. I never would've thought I'd be the type to get divorced after only five years
        of marriage, but here I am. It's been a crazy road, but it's incredible to look back on my experiences and see how
        much I've grown. I have nearly full custody of my two sweet babies, and they are my world. They make everything
        worth it every single day. Their smiles, their hugs, and their silly faces ensure I know that despite everything,
        I'm where I'm meant to be. As long as I'm their mother, things will be okay.</li>
      <li>I'm hoping to go back to school soon and pursue a PhD. I live for academia, and graduate school has always been
        on my radar. Right now, I'm mostly trying to create a stable life for myself and my kiddos, but I'm hoping soon
        that will include graduate work. I'm looking into a few MFA in Creative Writing programs, but I'm really excited
        about the possibility of a PhD program at the University of Utah. An MFA is usually the terminal degree in
        creative writing, so PhD programs are few and far between, but I think it sounds amazing, and it's definitely
        something I aspire to.</li>
      <li>I'm a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. My faith is a big part of who I am and where I
        come from. I've had struggles with my faith, especially recently, but I always come back to finding hope in
        Christ, and a calling to dedicate my life to His name. My beliefs are slightly more nuanced than you may expect,
        but when it comes down to it, I mostly believe that God loves us, and He asks us to love Him, and everyone else,
        in return.</li>
      <li>I play violin. Sort of. It's been a while since I picked it up, crazy as life has been, but music is a big part
        of my life. I even majored in Music Education before making the switch to English. I also play a little piano and
        sing, and I've even dabbled in percussion. I've participated in several pit orchestras and community orchestras,
        and I played bass drum in marching band during my senior year of high school. I loved all of it, and I really hope
        I can make more time for music again soon.</li>
      <li>I'm the oldest of four. I have two younger sisters, and one much younger brother. How much younger, you ask?
        Well, I was 18 when he was born! It's definitely an interesting dynamic, but I sure love that kid! My family has
        been a huge support to me as I've gone through my recent struggles and life changes, and I honestly don't know
        what I would've done without them. Living with all of them as an adult is rough sometimes, but I'm so grateful to
        have them!</li>
      <li>I am a chronic pain warrior. I have Complex Regional Pain Syndrome. CRPS is not well understood, even by
        experts, and it's very rare. But basically, it's a condition where the pain from an injury is far, far worse than
        would be expected, and it often causes abnormal swelling and nerve dysfunction. It's chronic, but remission is
        possible. It can be extremely painful, and has even been rated as more painful than childbirth and amputation. In
        my case, a mosquito bite on my right ankle developed into excruciating CRPS from the bottom of my foot to about
        mid-thigh within a few weeks back in 2018. I'm lucky in that I got diagnosed quickly and treatment was pretty
        effective, so I'm able to manage it without medication at the moment, except for the occasional ibuprofen. But I
        do have frequent flares that cause pain and swelling and require me to stay off my feet, and I have significant
        muscle loss in my calf. It's a daily struggle, but I'm mostly grateful it's not worse!</li>
      <li>I dream big. Perhaps this was made evident when I wrote earlier about my goal of obtaining a PhD. But that's not
        all! For some reason, I'm still under the impression that I have the ability to make some kind of a significant
        difference in the world. Of course, I also believe in the divine worth of each individual, so if I can make a
        difference for even one person, that's changing the world to me. I have big goals, big hopes, and big ideas about
        what I can do with a pen or a keyboard, but the most important goals I have center on my little family.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Did any of these surprise you? Do we have anything in common? Does any of this change your perception of me, or of
      the blog? Let me know! I would be fascinated to hear your perspective!</p>
