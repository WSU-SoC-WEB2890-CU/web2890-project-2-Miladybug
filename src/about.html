    <p>Hi there! I'm Sariah, and I am all about helping moms tune in to their creativity and tell their stories. Arts,
      crafts, and writing are all passions of mine, and I believe that the innate desire to create is one of the most
      divine characteristics we can be blessed with as women, as people, and as children of God. And that's where I come
      in! I'm here to help guide you on your creative journey by offering ideas, advice, and, if your preferred medium
      happens to be a pen or a typewriter, services! I am an experienced editor, and I would love to share my editorial
      services with you! While I love all forms of creativity, writing holds a special place in my heart, and I would be
      thrilled to work with you and help you tell your story.</p>
    <p>I wrote my first book when I was in kindergarten. It was a messy little thing, with a purple cover and scribbled
      illustrations of the Easter Bunny. But I vividly remember the pride I took in that silly little story, and I've
      been
      writing every since. I also worked my way through a variety of hobbies while growing up, eager to learn just about
      anything I could. I practiced drawing, beading, crochet, knitting, sewing, cross-stitch, and more. In sixth grade
      I
      picked up a violin for the first time, and my creative yearnings found their voice in music for the first time.
      While I now understand that my rapid-fire hobby seeking was likely related to undiagnosed ADHD, it was, and still
      is, a defining characteristic of who I am. I recall venting my frustrations with my changing interests to a friend
      once, explaining how much I wish I could just do everything, and he responded, “You're definitely Heavenly
      Father's
      daughter.” That simple statement changed my perspective, and I decided to embrace my calling as a
      multipotentialite,
      lifelong learner, jack-of-all-trades, whatever you want to call it.</p>
    <p>Becoming a mom, and then a single mom, also created some defining shifts in who I am. My kids are my world, and I
      live for sharing the world with them. Reading to them and watching them look at the pictures has become one of my
      favorite things, and the more they grow, the more I enjoy sharing other creative and education pursuits with them.
      As much as I am passionate about creativity, I live for my role as a mother. It is the highest and most precious
      calling I have blessed with, and I believe it is my duty to share all the wonders, stories, and love of the world
      with my beautiful, perfect children.</p>
    <p>With as many interests and hobbies as I have, deciding on a major and a career path was not an easy choice. But
      when looking back at my life, there was only one thing I had stuck with during every phase of my life, every up
      and
      down, every life event, and every twist and turn: BOOKS! Books had always been there for me. Reading and writing
      had
      gotten me through so many rough days, and so many beautiful ones. I have felt the desire to be a writer for as
      long
      as I could remember. So while it took me a while to get there, I really had no choice but to major in English, and
      to soak up every word, every story, and every grammar principle I possibly could. I loved my time as a college
      student, and I miss it terribly. I loved tearing into classics, writing research papers, and, yes, even
      diagramming
      sentences. My highest grades were in my grammar class and my Jane Austen class, and if that doesn't sum up my
      experience and expertise, I don't know what does! During my time as a student, I also spent a semester as the
      English Academic Society president, and attended two exclusive writing retreats, where I had to submit a short
      story
      to be evaluated before I was chosen to go. I also did an editorial internship with DZANC Books the summer before
      my
      senior year, and worked as a copyeditor on campus during my senior year. Each experience solidified for me that
      this
      was the path for me. This was where I could let my talents shine.</p>
    <p>After working as a stay-at-home mom for about three years after I graduated, my now-ex husband left me with no
      money, no income, and two precious kiddos to take care of. The job hunt was long and ugly, even more so than the
      divorce, but I eventually found contract work with hope*books, a beautiful little hybrid publishing company with a
      mission and values that spoke to me on a personal level. When applying for this job, I told myself, and God, that
      if
      I got this job, I would take it as my sign to pursue more freelance work, to make the jump into helping writers
      individually craft their incredible stories, and to embrace self-employment.</p>
    <p>So now I'm here! Creating, writing, and editing to my heart's content. And I hope to help you do the same! Lean
      into your creativity, my friend, and let it fill your heart the way it has filled mine. Let me show you what
      amazing
      things it can do for you. If you write, check out my editing services page, and let me know how I can help! If
      not,
      I have content on a variety of other creative topics, including reading, bullet journaling, watercolor, sewing,
      Cricut crafting, and creative motherhood.</p>
    <p>What can I help you create?</p>
