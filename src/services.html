      <p class="card-body p-0">Line editing takes place before copyediting and after developmental editing. During this
        phase, I will examine your manuscript sentence-by-sentence, leaving suggestions on word choice, tone, and
        cohesion. A line edit does not focus on grammar, but on readability.</p>

      <h4 class="card-title text-center pb-1">($0.02-0.03/word)</h4>
      <p class="card-body p-0">Copyediting takes place before formatting. A copyedit focuses on grammar, clarity,
        syntax,
        and consistency, as well as ensuring the manuscript follows the chosen style guide (typically Chicago Manual of
        Style). I may do some fact checking, but I am not responsible for checking all the research. Copyediting is my
        specialty!</p>

      <p class="card-body p-0">Proofreading is the final review before a manuscript goes to print. This takes place
        after
        the book has been formatted. I will look for minor grammar and punctuation mistakes, as well as formatting
        errors.
